## Running the project on a local server

To start the project you need to:
* create react app: 
  `npx create-react-app my-app`
* in the created folder replace the files `public` and `src`
* go to the project directory and run the package manager
  `cd my-app`
  `npm start`
 
It is also possible to run a ready-made `build':
* download the `build` folder from the github repository
* Go to the directory with the build
* run the build on the local server
`serve -s build`
